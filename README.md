Module 20 Challenge for UT Full-Stack Bootcamp

## Description
A single-page website meant to showcase my ability as a Full Stack developer, for the purposes of job-hunting. It should be able to show a recruiter all basic information such as job history, experience, contact information, etc, as well as being a demonstration of job-skills on it's own as well.
