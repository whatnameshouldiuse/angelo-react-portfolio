                        Hello! I am Hyunjun Jeon, going by Angelo.
                        I studied at the Rhode Island School of Design, and graduated with a BFA in Illustration.
                        Alongside art, I&#39;ve been studying programming alongside throughout my life.
                        With each career choice and project I take on, I strive to apply my multidisciplinary skills to create what is truly unique,
                        and something that bridges gaps between different fields.
                    </p>
